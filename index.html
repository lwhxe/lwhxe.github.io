                    <p>Hello!<br><br>My name is <strong>Alex</strong> but you can call me <strong>LW</strong>.<br>This website was created to be a hub for a bunch of other websites that I've created or used in the past.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com" class="button"><img src="https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GitHub-logo.png"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague" class="button"><img src="https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/ytc/APkrFKbO_KZM4q6NGNcfydgwLYvJnx1z0uuvUXsBTEC02g=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown" class="button"><img src="https://i.redd.it/xh8f1sjrxf551.png"</img></a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips" class="button"><img src="https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/Vy6KL7EM_apxPSxF0pPy5w_c87YDTOlBQo3MADDF0Wl51kwxmt9wmRotnt2xQXwlrcyO0Xe56w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/dh4FpkdyUN" class="button"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/1144717413947015298/787322e48f752938945b2f0d83a59f48.webp?size=1024&width=0&height=256"></a><br><br>I've got a knack for solving puzzles and inventing new stuff, especially when it involves tech. There's nothing quite like the thrill of cracking a code or dreaming up the next big thing.<br><br>Most of my time, you'll find me online, where I dive into video games or share my latest garden triumphs. Gaming is my way of tackling new challenges and going on adventures, all from my computer chair. And when I step away from the screens, I'm out in the garden, getting my hands into the earth and making things grow.<br><br>Hanging out with friends online is a big deal for me. We're often laughing over memes, discussing new game strategies, or just catching up on each other's days. Even though we're not always in the same place, we're connected in all the ways that count.<br><br>Looking ahead, I'm plugged into a future full of possibilities. I've got my eye on some goals and I'm ready to level up. Life's a bit like a game, and I'm playing to win, learning new tricks every day, and hoping to pass on a few tips to others on their own journey. So what's next? Whatever it is, I'm here for it, ready to dive in and see where the next click takes me. Let's do this.<br><br>Thank You!</p>
